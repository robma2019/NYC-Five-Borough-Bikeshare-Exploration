Forked (https://github.com/Shah-Mazhar/NYC-Tri-Borough-Bikeshare-Exploration) and updated to work with 5 boroughs. 

Python:

•	Created a bikeshare model that keeps tracks of 90 bikes of 5 boroughs for 16 hours' time period using Pint and Modsim in Google Colab.

•	Generated a graph using TimeSeries() and Decorate() functions that shows the number of bikes per hour.

•	Wrote two pages of comprehensive content that explains the objective, methodology, results and analysis of the project.
